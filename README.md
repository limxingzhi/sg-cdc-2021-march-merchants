The only official list of merchants accepting CDC vouchers that I can find is in PDF form. I've manually converted the list to `.xls` and `.pdf`. 
If anyone wants to use this data for research or business purposes, please check the compliance and governing rules with the appropriate authorities. 
I take no credit for any data listed here.

This information is accurate as of 20th March
